# Introduction #

I start this wiki page for people not familiar with satellite and thunderstorm. The objectif is to explain the install procedure for a correct usage.

This procedure is quite simple for **Windows** users. For Linux and Mac users it is a little more complex and will be described later on.


# Step by Step Procedure #

## 1) Download and save the Satellite compressed archive file ##
[Clik here](http://esdanalysistools.googlecode.com/files/Satellite-0.7a2.win32.zip)
or go to the downloads tab and click on
  * Satellite-0.7a2.win32.zip


## 2) Unzip the zip file ##

You should know how ;-)

## 3) Enter the newly created Satellite-0.7a2.win32 folder ##

You should then file a file named: "run\_satellite.exe" and few
folders and files.

**Everything is done by now you just have to use it !!!**

## 4) Double click on run\_satellite.exe ##

Satellite main window should appear quite quickly on your screen.
Satellite main window has two parts a list of TLP file on the left and a graphical view on the right.


## 5) Download a set of data ##

Optionally, you can also get a set of sample to verify satellite is working perfectly. To do so, as before go on downloads tab et get the file name:

[` TestData01012012.zip`](http://esdanalysistools.googlecode.com/files/TestData01012012.zip)

save the file somewhere on your disk and unzip it.


You will now have data to evaluate satellite.

## 6) Getting started... ##

File->importXXX  and select the files you would like to work with.

After few seconds your measurements are available in the left list of the main window.

Select the list elements your would like to overlay the TLP data.

Rigth click on a list element to dive in your data...
